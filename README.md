# tea-timer

A minimalistic tea brewing app for gong-fu style tea brewing sessions.

Created with the help of ChatGPT (since I'm not a Javascript person ;)).

Save e.g. to the iOS start screen to hava a full-window app.

## Features
- Minimalistic UI, start the steeping with a click or tap.
- iOS-style progress indicator showing the number of the steeping, steeping temperature and steeping time.
- Customizable color of the ring-shaped progress indicator.
- Configurable list of tea style favorites by customizing the section 'Tea definitions'.
- A steeping cannot be stopped, but you can select a different iteration or tea type any time.
