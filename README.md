# tea-timer

A minimalistic tea brewing app for gong-fu style tea brewing sessions.

Created with the help of ChatGPT (since I'm not a Javascript person ;)).

Save e.g. to the iOS start screen to have a full-screen app.

## Features
- Minimalistic UI, start the steeping with a click or tap.
- iOS-style progress indicator showing steeping temperature and steeping time.
- Selection of tea types and steepings via pulldown menus. These can be customized by editing `teas.js`,
  along with the color of the ring-shaped progress indicator.
- A steeping cannot be stopped, but you can select a different iteration or tea type any time.
