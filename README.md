# tea-timer

A minimalistic tea brewing app for gong-fu style tea brewing sessions.

Created with the help of ChatGPT (since I'm not a Javascript person ;)).

## Features
- minimalistic UI, start the steeping with a click or tap.
- iOS-style progress indicator showing the number of the steeping, steeping temperature and steeping time.
- customizable color of the ring-shaped progress indicator.
- configurable for your favorite teas by customizing the section 'Tea definitions'.
